These observations must typically include at least the equipment and, if appropriate, the retrieval, but also any ringing control or direct sightings for instance.\n\n{:.alert .alert-info}\nYou can think of `observations` as your log entries in your ringing book.\n\nAn observation is described by at least, the `datetime` of the observation, the location (`latitude` and `longitude`), the `ring_number` of the bird and the type of observations `observation_type` (e.g., equipment, retrieval or control). In addition, we require also `age` and `age_class` (which can be set as unknown `U`).\n\n Also include the ringing events of any control group (i.e., birds ringed but not equipped with a tag).",

Recapture/retrap are not hard coded in the dataset, but inferred from consecutive capture of the same `ring_number`. \n - `sighting`: Known presence of the bird on a date and location besides ringing (e.g. direct observation in the field with color ring)\n - `other`: Other type of observation.
